## Introduction 
Centralized Club Operations (CCO) is a fully-fledged club management system designed to handle the activities of a club. It provides two sets of functionalities to use, depending on whether you're a teacher or a student. While teachers get access to the administrative features, students can access and partake in various club-related activities.  

This project was developed as part of our course requirement. The requirements and scope of this project kept changing and expanding throughout the six months of the semester, and this is the final version we presented in front of our faculty.  

## How to use?
You can either clone the repo in Android Studio by going to **File → New → Project from Version Control → copy and paste the repo URL** or [**download the pre-built app from here**. ](https://github.com/wolverton120/centralized-club-operations/blob/master/app/release/CCO.apk) You'd need an android device in order to run the app.

## Teacher Access 
In order to register/login and access the teacher-side features, you’ll need a teacher ID, which is set to **123456** for now. 

## Disclaimer
Although the app is fully functional for all the features it provides, it was developed with a single club in mind. Hence, the entire app uses a single database. I might try to implement some kind of "create club" function in the future, which will incorporate separate databases for each set of teachers and students, but with the main purpose of this project completed, I’m not really sure.  

This app relies on Google's Firebase services for its online user authentication and database storage. If something breaks somewhere in the future, it's probably due to them. Do let me know if that happens. :3
